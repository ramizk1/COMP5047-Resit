Task 2: Software Quality Requirements for CloudTables-Customer

2.1 Security and Privacy
The CloudTables-Customer application handles sensitive personal and transactional information, including user identification details, booking records, and payment interactions. To ensure confidentiality, integrity, and compliance with data protection regulations, the system must meet the following security and privacy requirements:
•	Authenticated restaurant customers shall have the ability to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their own data, including their profiles, table bookings, food pre-orders, reviews, and payment history. No other user type (e.g., restaurant staff, managers, or other customers) shall have access to customer data through the CloudTables-Customer interface. Role-based access control (RBAC) shall be used to enforce these permissions across all system operations.
•	All communication between the mobile application and the backend system must be secured using HTTPS with TLS 1.3 or higher. Any unencrypted transmission shall be considered a failure.
•	All sensitive customer data stored in the backend database, such as booking history and contact details, must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption. Plaintext storage must be avoided.
•	Sessions must expire after 15 minutes of inactivity. Any access beyond this period must prompt re-authentication to continue the session.
•	The application must allow users to delete their accounts and export their stored personal data in a human-readable format, thereby complying with data privacy regulations such as GDPR.

2.2 Performance
Performance is critical for ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience when searching for restaurants, booking tables, and viewing menus. The system must deliver low latency and efficient processing under normal and peak loads. The following requirements define the expected performance standards:
•	The system shall return restaurant search results within 1 second for at least 95% of user requests under normal usage.
•	Booking a table, including form submission and confirmation, shall complete within 2 seconds for at least 95% of transactions.
•	The mobile app shall launch and load its home interface within 3 seconds on devices using a 3G or faster network.
•	Table availability updates must reflect on the customer-facing application within 2 seconds of any changes made at the restaurant.
•	Menu content, including images and descriptions, must load within 1.5 seconds after a customer accesses the relevant section.

2.3 Reliability
Reliability refers to the system's ability to operate consistently and recover gracefully from faults. For customers relying on the app for bookings and pre-orders, uninterrupted access and consistent data handling are essential. The following requirements establish the system's expected reliability:
•	The system shall maintain an uptime of 99.9% over any calendar month. This allows for a maximum of 43 minutes of downtime per month.
•	The application shall recover from server or client-side crashes within 5 minutes, preserving session data where applicable.
•	In the event of backend failure, customer booking and order data must be recoverable from automated backups performed every 24 hours.
•	If an operation fails (e.g., booking, pre-order), the app must notify the user with a clear error message and present an option to retry.
•	All bookings and pre-orders shall be implemented using atomic transactions to ensure no partial state occurs in case of failure.

2.4 Scalability
To accommodate growth in users and participating restaurants, the CloudTables-Customer system must scale horizontally and maintain performance as demand increases. Scalability ensures that the app functions well under load and can evolve with business needs. The following requirements define scalability expectations:
•	The system must support at least 5,000 concurrent users without degrading average response times beyond 3 seconds.
•	Load balancing mechanisms must distribute traffic across multiple servers using algorithms such as round-robin or least-connections.
•	The backend services must support horizontal scaling through containerisation technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to manage growing demand.
•	- The system database must support partitioning and replication to maintain performance as the number of daily active users exceeds 10,000.
•	- The mobile app must maintain responsive UI and functionality across devices with screen sizes ranging from 5 to 13 inches.
